      <h1>Process Sychronization</h1>
      <h2>When two or more process cooperates with each other, their order of execution must be preserved otherwise there can be conflicts in their execution and inappropriate outputs can be produced.

A cooperative process is the one which can affect the execution of other process or can be affected by the execution of other process. Such processes need to be synchronized so that their order of execution can be guaranteed.

The procedure involved in preserving the appropriate order of execution of cooperative processes is known as Process Synchronization. There are various synchronization mechanisms that are used to synchronize the processes.

              Process Synchronization</b> means sharing system resources by processes in a such a way that,
                                Concurrent access to shared data is handled thereby minimizing the chance of inconsistent data. Maintaining data consistency demands mechanisms to ensure synchronized execution of cooperating processes.</p>

                                                            A Critical Section is a code segment that accesses shared variables and has to be executed as an atomic action. It means that in a group of cooperating processes,
                                                            at a given point of time, only one process must be executing its critical section. If any other process also wants to execute its critical section, it must wait until the first one finishes.<br>
                                                            <br><u>Solution</u><br>

                                                            Out of a group of cooperating processes, only one process can be in its critical section at a given point of time.<br>

                                                            If no process is in its critical section, and if one or more threads want to execute their critical section then any one of these threads must be allowed to get into its critical section.<br>

                                                            After a process makes a request for getting into its critical section, there is a limit for how many other processes can get into their critical section, before this process's request is granted.
                                                            So after the limit is reached, system must grant the process permission to get into its critical section.

              <p class="description">In computing, the producer–consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem.
                                    The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue.<br>
                                    1.The producer’s job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again.<br>
                                    2.At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e. removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time.<br>
                                    <b>Problem :</b><br>
                                    To make sure that the producer won’t try to add data into the buffer if it’s full and that the consumer won’t try to remove data from an empty buffer.</p>

              <p class="description">Consider a situation where we have a file shared between many people.<br>
                                    1.If one of the people tries editing the file, no other person should be reading or writing at the same time, otherwise changes will not be visible to him/her.<br>
                                    2.However if some person is reading the file, then others may read it at the same time.<br>
                                    Precisely in OS we call this situation as the <b>readers-writers problem</b>.<br>

                                    2.Once a writer is ready, it performs its write. Only one writer may write at a time.<br>
                                    3.If a process is writing, no other process can read it.<br>
                                    4.If at least one reader is reading, no other process can write.<br>

                                    There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pick-up the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both. </p><br>
