## OS-Simulator

### Instructions for developers

- Please create a new directory at the root of the project(os-sim). Put all your HTML, CSS, JS files in that directory. The entry point to your component will be the `index.html` file.
- After creating the entire component, you would have to link your independent component to the homepage by just adding a link to the corresponding icon on the homepage.
- It is expected that each of the algorithm that you create, should have a simulation and also a wiki associated with it. Create all the files accordingly.
- Any dependencies that you download like CSS  libraries etc. should be in that local directory, do not pollute the root directory.
- Before trying to push, first pull the project once. After that only push your changes. Ideally if you work in your own component's directory, you should now get any merge conflicts, but if you get any, please do not `rebase` or `force push`.

### Instructions for running the project

- Simply clone the repository
- Go to the root directory and open the `index.html` file with a web browser(Recommended is chrome).
